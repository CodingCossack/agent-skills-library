# Agent Skills Library for Programming Workflows

A curated, production-focused library of “agent skills” for programming workflows (code review, systematic debugging, verification-before-completion, subagent orchestration, etc.).

## Provenance / Upstream

This repository is an updated, ground-up rework of the skills from **obra/superpowers**:

- Upstream skills: https://github.com/obra/superpowers/tree/main/skills
- This repo: polished + reorganised skills, tighter workflows, clearer templates, and improved guardrails.

### What changed vs upstream (high level)
- Rewritten skill docs for stronger execution order + verification gates.
- More consistent structure across skills (references/templates/scripts where needed).
- Better “do the thing” ergonomics: fewer meta instructions, more executable steps.
- + Lot's more
